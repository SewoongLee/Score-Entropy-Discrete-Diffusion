Here\u2019s the big problem with the Internet: there are apparently endless hordes of targets. Yes, most of them conservative, and yes, some of the targets are actually liberal. Eventually, conservatives get together to back out and everyone involved with the attacks is forced to go to a different table. But eventually, whatever the issue is, as soon as the endless lies and falsifications continue, they are satisfied by the fact that no longer exists a counter. This is how you do it."

It has not been completely successful, but this is on the safer side. It is also easy-and-effective-to provide a real quick strategy.  On the flip side,this is how to challenge verbal stalking behavior.  This is a simple message, some of my readers think of it as \"defusing a man from walking down.\" I take that seriously.  This is how you do it."
